# PWC_analysis_and_dashboards
- This repository contains 3 projects done for PWC virtual internship.
    - ## Project 1
    - Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 

        - Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

            - Overall customer satisfaction
            - Overall calls answered/abandoned
            - Calls by time
            - Average speed of answer
            - Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
         
        - DataSets -> Call-Center_Data-Set-PWC.xlsx, Call Center SOlutions PWC.pbix
         
    - ## Project 2
    - A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
      In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
 
        - To Do

            - Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
            - The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
            - Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
            - We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
            - We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
            - The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

    - ## Project 3
    - Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for         help.
 
        - To Do

            - Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation
            - Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be
